# Needleman-Wunsh algorithm
Project in Python language for Bioinformatics course starting october '20, aimed at implementing Needleman-Wunsh algorithm.

## System requirements
Python 3.x, packages numpy, sys.

## How to download the program
There are two ways to download the program, directly from github and by terminal.

### Github

1. Click button **Clone or download**.

2. Click button **Download ZIP**.

3. Extract all files from the .zip file.

### Terminal

1. Copy link **https://github.com/paldynaagata/Needleman-Wunsh_algorithm**.

2. In terminal write command **git clone** and paste above link.

## How to run the program
In terminal by python from catalog src run file **run.py** with parameters that are paths to files, according to the following formula:

**run.py [path_to_seq_1] [path_to_seq_2] [path_to_config_file] [path_to_output_file]**

e.g.: 

/opt/anaconda/bin/python run.py ../data/seq1.txt ../data/seq2.txt ../configs/config.txt ../results/output.txt
